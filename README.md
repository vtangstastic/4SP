##Introduction:##
4SP stands for 4 Straight Points. In this project, we utilize point.py to extract the coordinates of each point and main.py to execute the main functionality.

##Objective:##
The primary objective is to identify any pair of 4 points that form a straight line and subsequently pair them together. The output will display these point pairs.

##Usage:##
1. Ensure that point.py contains the necessary functions for extracting point coordinates.
2. Utilize main.py to execute the main function for detecting and pairing 4 straight points.
3. Review the printed output to observe the identified point pairs.

##Contributions:##
Feel free to make edits or suggestions to enhance the functionality or clarity of the code.```
