## 4SP STANDS FOR 4 STRAIGHT POINTS ##
Here, we're trying to using point.py to extract the coordinates of each point and use main.py to perform the main function

Our goal here is to be able to find any pair of 4 points that make a straight line and pair them together.
Afterwards, we print them out

Please feel free to edit or make any suggestions
